# Algorithmic trading 

This application automates the process of trading assets by leveraging a Bollinger Band strategy that executes trades once "buy" or "sell" conditions are met.

## Purpose
Our goal is to create an algorithmic trading strategy using signals. To do this we are using current/historic stock data of Microsft "MSFT". The sources we are analyzing are Alpaca and Yahoo Finance. This program leverages the power of Python and Pandas to collect, prepare, and analyze neccessary data. First, it uses APIs to get the latest price data. Next, it cleans the data and consolidates relevant information into a DataFrame. Last, the algorithm generates Bollinger Bands which our model uses to execute buy and sell orders.
